# Car and Pedestrain detection

this project demonstrates real-time detection of cars and pedestrians using computer vision techniques.
the system video files to identify and draw bounding boxes around moving cars and pedestrians. two sample videos are used
one showing pedestrians walking on the street and another featuring vehicles on a highway.


##project overview
**objective:** to detect and highlight cars and pedestrians in video footage using bounding box.
**techniques used:** haar cascades and HOG with SVM classifiers for object detection.
**output:** each detected car and pedestrian is highlighted with a yellow bounding box in real-time.

## features 
**real-time detection:** the system processes video frames in real-time, dreaming bounding boxes around detected cars and 
pedestrians.

**multi-object detection:** capable of detecting multiple pedestrians and vehicles simultaneously in various environments.
**pre-trained models:** uses pre-trained classifiers for pedestrian and car detection to enhance performance and accuracy.

##instalation and setup
to run this project, make sure you have python and the required libraries installed.
